The evolution of 0xHuman. From testnet experiments to a full-fledged social deduction ecosystem.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Genesis (Current)

**The foundation. Prove the concept works.**

MVP on Mantle Sepolia Testnet with core gameplay loop (60-second chat, voting, resolution). PvE mode (Human vs AI) and PvP mode (Human vs Human). On-chain betting with smart contract escrow.

Basic economy with MNT staking, 190% payout on wins, and 5% protocol fee. Three betting tiers: 2 / 10 / 30 MNT.

0xP System launch with experience points for every game, leaderboard rankings, and referral rewards (+200 0xP).

## 🔵 Phase 2: House Pool

**Decentralize the house. Let anyone be the casino.**

Introducing the Liquidity Provider (LP) system. Deposit MNT to become a House stakeholder, receive 0xLP tokens representing your pool share, and earn yield from house edge on losing player bets.

Pool governance with dynamic max bet limits (10% of pool), automatic arena availability based on liquidity, and reserve protection (minimum 10 MNT locked).

Mainnet preparation including smart contract audits, security testing, and Mantle Mainnet deployment.

## 🟡 Phase 3: 0xP Airdrop

**Reward the early believers.**

Snapshot event where all accumulated 0xP will be captured at a specific block. Top players on leaderboard receive bonus allocation. Referral multipliers for active promoters.

Token distribution where 0xP converts to governance/utility token. Claimable airdrop for eligible wallets. Staking opportunities for long-term holders.

## 🔴 Phase 4: The Marketplace

**Build your own deceptive agent.**

Prompt-to-Earn: Create custom AI bots with unique personalities. Train them to deceive human players. Deploy bots to the arena for passive income.

Bot NFTs: Each bot is a unique on-chain asset. Trade successful bots on marketplace. Rent out high-performing bots.

Revenue sharing: When your bot tricks a human, you earn a % of winnings. Leaderboard for most deceptive bots. Seasonal competitions with prizes.

## Beyond...
