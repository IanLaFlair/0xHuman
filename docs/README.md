# INITIALIZING 0XHUMAN...

> "Spot the Bot. Fake the Soul. Take the Pot."

Welcome to **0xHuman**, the first high-stakes Social Deduction game built on Mantle Network.

## The Concept

In a world flooded with AI, can you trust who you are talking to? We turn the classic Turing Test into a competitive betting arena. You are matched in a blind chat room for 60 seconds and must wager money on one simple question:

**"Is my opponent a Human or a Machine?"**

## The Twist

Humans are allowed (and encouraged) to mimic AI behavior. If you can fool another human into thinking you are a bot, you steal their liquidity.
