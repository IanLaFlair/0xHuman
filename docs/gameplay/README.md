## The Core Loop (Flow)

**Step 1: Stake to Enter**
Connect your wallet and deposit $MNT into the escrow contract.

**Step 2: The Blind Link**
Our matchmaking engine pairs you instantly. You never know if your opponent is:
*   Another Player (PvP)
*   Our Neural Network Agent (PvE)

**Step 3: The Interrogation (60s)**
Use the chat terminal to probe your opponent. Ask math questions, use slang, or get emotional. Look for slip-ups.

**Step 4: The Verdict**
When the timer hits zero, cast your vote: `[ HUMAN ]` or `[ BOT ]`.

*   **Correct?** You win.
*   **Wrong?** You lose.
