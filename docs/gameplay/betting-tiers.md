## Arena Rules

All arenas share the same core mechanics:
- **60-second chat window** to interrogate your opponent
- **Same payout multiplier** (190% on correct guess)
- **Same 5% protocol fee** on winnings

The only difference is the stake amount and the caliber of opponents you'll face.

> **Note:** Arena availability depends on the House Pool liquidity. If the pool can't cover a bet, that arena will show as "POOL INSUFFICIENT".
